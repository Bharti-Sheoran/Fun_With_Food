         <p style="font-size: 23px; margin-left: 20px;">Seated along rows of north–south-running mountain ridges, isolated and pristine Mizoram sees few tourists, which makes the verdant, hilly countryside beyond the capital Aizawl a tempting target for off-the-beaten-track adventurers. The predominant ethnic Mizo population has much in common with related groups in Myanmar's neighbouring Chin Province, including Christianity. The formerly animist and headhunting Mizos were converted by colonial missionaries between the 1890s and 1930s, and Mizo culture today is liberated from caste and gender distinctions. People of both sexes wear Western-style clothing except on special occasions, such as Sunday, when women don the colourful traditional puan wraparound skirt for church services (men wear shirts and ties).

Free of political unrest since becoming a separate state in 1987, Mizoram runs at its own rhythm. Most businesses shut by 6pm and virtually everything closes entirely on Sunday.
