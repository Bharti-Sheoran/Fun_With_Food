         <p style="font-size: 23px; margin-left: 20px;">West Bengal is a state in eastern India, between the Himalayas and the Bay of Bengal. Its capital, Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), retains architectural and cultural remnants of its past as an East India Company trading post and capital of the British Raj. The city's colonial landmarks include the government buildings around B.B.D. Bagh Square, and the iconic Victoria Memorial, dedicated to Britain's queen.Bengali, the main language of the state, is spoken by much of the population. Other languages include Hindi, Santali, Urdu (primarily the language of Muslims), and Nepali (spoken largely in the area of Darjiling). A small number of people speak Kurukh, the language of the Oraon indigenous group. English, together with Bengali, is the language of administration, and English and Hindi serve as lingua francas at the national level.

          <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">Make a mental note, Bengalis love poppy seeds. They really do and why won't they, it makes food so much tastier! This preparation above is also made of poppy or Posto as the Bengalis like to call it. It is a preparation of Posto with potatoes and pointed gourd, complete with red and green chillies and sometimes coconut puree to add some much-needed spice to it. It truly is one of the classic Bengali dishes and famous food of West Bengal!

          <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">As you are familiar with the fact that Bengal has a rich source of fresh water as well as saltwater fishes, you might also know the fact that Bengal tries a lot of different varieties of fishes. The Tangra fish is basically the catfish that is found in the freshwater bodies abound in the region. The fish is prepared with freshly ground spices, and the thin curry is light on the stomach and also supremely tasty too. It is a big hit among the Bengalis in the region.

          <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">A relatively dry Bengali Mithai, Shondesh can come in many variants. Made with Condensed milk Sugar and/or Jaggery this dessert can be moulded into different shapes and designs. We recommend having a Nolen Gurer Shondesh, which is made with a special and extra delicious kind of jaggery. Another variant which you might like is the Jol Bhara Sandesh. In the modern trend of fusion desserts, today you can also try out recipes such as chocolate Sandesh.
