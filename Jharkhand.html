         <p style="font-size: 23px; margin-left: 20px;">Jharkhand is a state in eastern India.  It was carved out of the southern part of Bihar state on 2000-11-15.  Jharkhand is bordered by the states of Bihar to the north, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh to the west, Orissa to the south, and West Bengal to the east.

The industrial city of Ranchi is its capital.  The other major cities, all highly industrialised cities of eastern India, are Jamshedpur, Bokaro, and Dhanbad.

Jharkhand is also popularly known as Vananchal.  The word Vananchal is derived from combination of two Hindi words: Vana meaning "forests", and anchal meaning "area" – thus the word "Vananchal" denotes a land mass covered with forests.

Jharkhand is known for its mineral wealth and forestry products together with excellent human resources.</p>

                           For the Outer Rice layer:-

                           <li>Heat a pan with water with salt added. When the water starts boiling, simmer and add rice flour and quickly stir everything together. Even if there are lumps, it’s alright.</li>

<li>Cook till everything blends together and keep it covered.</li>

<li>Heat a pan with a tsp oil, saute the ground dal mix and cook it for couple minutes, making sure the stuffing is not burnt but cooked well. The paste should still be moist.</li>

To make the Pithas:-

<li>Divide the dough into equal balls, with greased hands, Flatten the balls, with sides thin and centre thicker, place the dal mixture and enclose it completely.</li>

<li>Fold it to make gujiya/kajjikaya like shape. Work the seam with oiled hands so as to get smooth edges. Or you can make it as Kozhukattai</li>

<li>Steam these pithas in a greased steamer till the daal filling gets cooked and knife comes out clean.</li>
