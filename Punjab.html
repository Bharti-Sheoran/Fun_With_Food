         <img src="img/punjab.jpg" alt="Punjab" class="right" style="border: 4px solid brown;">
         <p style="font-size: 23px; margin-left: 20px;">Punjab is a state in northwest region of India and is one of the most prosperous states.
The name Punjab is made of two words Punj (Five) + Aab (Water) i.e. land of five rivers. These five rivers of Punjab are Sutlej, Beas, Ravi, Chenab, and Jhelum. Only Sutlej, Ravi and Beas rivers flow in today’s Punjab. The other two rivers are now in the state of Punjab, situated in Pakistan. The Punjab State is divided into three regions: Majha, Doaba and Malwa.
Agriculture is the mainstay of Punjab’s economy. Other major industries include manufacturing of scientific instruments, electrical goods, financial services, machine tools, textiles, sewing machines etc..Punjab is bounded on the west by Pakistan, on the north by Jammu and Kashmir, on the northeast by Himachal Pradesh and on the south by Haryana and Rajasthan.Punjabi, the official language of the state, is the tenth most widely spoken language in the world. It is also the fourth most spoken language in Asia. Chandigarh is a union territory and serves as the capital of the states of Punjab and Haryana. It is one of the early planned cities in the post-independence India.</p>

          <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">While chicken may very well be called the national bird of Punjab, butter chicken is the crowning jewel of the food of Punjab. While it may not have originated in Punjab, it was invented by a Punjabi family so that counts, right? No celebration can be complete without this delicacy. This creamy, gravy dish is lightly spiced and paired up with either naan or rumaali roti.<br>

                    For the samosa wrappers:
                    <li>2 cups unbleached all purpose flour</li>
<li>1 tsp ajwain seeds (carom seeds)</li>
<li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
<li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
For the stuffing:
<li>5 medium potatoes (yellow or red, boiled until tender and coarsely chopped)</li>
<li>1/2 cup peas (frozen peas work best here. If using fresh, cook the peas until tender before using)</li>
<li>1 tsp ginger (grated)</li>
<li>2 tbsp cilantro (minced)</li>
<li>1 tsp vegetable oil</li>
<li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
<li>2 tsp coriander powder</li>
<li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
<li>1 tsp pomegranate seed powder (anardana powder, optional)</li>
<li>1 tsp chaat masala (both the chaat masala and the pomegranate seed add tartness. You can if you just can't get these, substitute with the juice of half a lemon)</li>
<li>1/2 serrano pepper (or jalapeno, minced)</li>
<li>Salt to taste</li>
<li>Vegetable oil for deep frying (you need enough for the samosas to be mostly immersed while frying)</li>
                               </ul>

                                   <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
                                       Make the dough for the wrapper:
                                       <li>Mix the flour, carom seeds, oil and salt in a large bowl or in a stand mixer.</li>
<li>Add water, half a cup at first and then a tablespoon at a time, and knead until you have a very stiff dough. You want to be very sure your dough is very stiff and not soft. Cover the dough and set aside while you make the filling</li>
<li>Make the peas potato filling:</li>
<li>Crumble the potatoes with your fingers so you have a few lumps -- you don't want to mash these like you would if you were making mashed potatoes. You want some texture in here.</li>
<li>Heat the oil.</li>
<li>Add the cumin seeds and, as they start to brown, add the ginger.</li>
<li>Saute the ginger for 30 seconds, the add the coriander leaves and the green chili pepper. Saute for a few seconds.</li>
<li>Add the coriander powder, turmeric, pomegranate seed powder and chaat masala (or lemon juice if you're using that instead). Stir to mix.</li>
<li>Add the potatoes and mix well.</li>
<li>Add the peas and stir-fry until the peas are tender and the mixture is very dry, about two to three more minutes.</li>
<li>Add salt to taste. Turn off the heat and let the filling cool slightly.</li>
Make the samosas:
<li>Divide the dough into 7 equal balls.</li>
<li>Roll out each ball into an oval, about six inches long and four inches wide. Use some oil to coat the countertop if needed to keep the dough from sticking.</li>
<li>Using a pizza cutter, cut across the long side of the oval to create two semicircular pieces.</li>
<li>Coat the edges of each semicircle with water.</li>
<li>Pick the two corners of the semicircle and bring them together, edges overlapping slightly, to form a cone. Press down on the seam to stick it. It's important to do this thoroughly because you don't want your samosas to open while you're frying them.</li>
<li>Inside the cone, place a few teaspoons of the filling.</li>
<li>Now seal the top of the samosa by pressing the top seam together and back.</li>
<li>Repeat for remaining 13 samosas.</li>
<li>In a wok or a frying pan, heat three inches of oil.</li>
<li>When the oil reaches 300 degrees Fahrenheit, drop the samosas, one at a time, taking care not to crowd the pan or you'll end up bringing the oil temperature down very fast. I have an eight-inch wok and I fry three samosas at a time.</li>
<li>Fry the samosas, turning over occasionally, until they are golden-brown.</li>
<li>Drain on paper towels before serving with a date-tamarind chutney.</li>
