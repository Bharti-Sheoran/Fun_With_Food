             Odisha also formerly Orissa, is an Indian state located on the Eastern India.The term "Odisha" is derived from the ancient Prakrit word "Odda Visaya" (also "Udra Bibhasha" or "Odra Bibhasha") as in the Tirumalai inscription of Rajendra Chola I, which is dated to 1025.The majority of people in Odisha are Hindu and there is also a rich cultural heritage in the state.Odia is the official language of Odisha and is spoken by 82.7% of the population according to the 2011 census of India.Odisha has a culinary tradition spanning centuries. The syrupy dessert Pahala rasagola made in Odisha is known throughout the world.

             <div class="left"><p style="font-size: 30px; color: green; margin-left: 20px;">How to makedChenna Poda</p>
                 <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
                     Preparation
                     <li>Firstly line a baking pan with some chopped banana leaves. Grease the banana leaves with some ghee. </li>
                     <li>You can also use butter paper or parchment paper instead of banana leaves. Or you can skip everything and just grease the pan with ghee on all sides. </li>
                     <li>Also preheat oven at 180 degrees celsius for 15 minutes.</li>
Making chhena poda mixture
<li>Then take the 250 grams fresh paneer or chenna and crumble it very well.</li>
<li>Then add ½ cup sugar. You can also use ½ cup jaggery powder instead of sugar.</li>
<li>With clean hands mix sugar with the chenna.</li>
<li>Then continue to mash and knead the paneer or chenna like the way you would knead a chapati dough.</li>
<li>The paneer mixture has to become loose, light and with a cake batter like consistency. The more light and softer the consistency, the better the chhena poda tastes.</li>
<li>I have not added any milk or water. In case the mixture looks dry, then you can add a few tablespoons of milk or water. Some amount of fat is released while mashing chenna and thats fine.</li>
<li>Once you get a cake batter like consistency in the paneer mixture, then add ½ teaspoon cardamom powder and ½ tablespoon rice flour. Optionally a pinch of baking soda can also be added, but does not make any difference. Instead of rice flour, you can also use fine rava (sooji). Some chopped dry fruits like cashews, almonds and raisins can also be added.</li>
Baking chhena poda
<li>Pour the chhena poda mixture in the pan. Shake the pan gently so that the chenna poda mixture spreads evenly. Level the top with a spatula.</li>
<li>Place the pan in the oven and bake chena poda for 30 to 45 minutes. If using otg, use the toast mode and keep pan in the center. Bake chena poda till the top crust gets a dark golden color. Oven times vary, so do keep a check. In some ovens this paneer cake can even take less time. I am giving an average time that will work for most ovens.</li>
<li>Remove from the oven once done.</li>
<li>Then check with a bamboo skewer or toothpick and it should be clean. There should be no sticky batter on the toothpick.</li>
<li>Let the paneer cake cool completely in the pan. Then remove it.</li>
<li>You can slice and then serve chenna poda. Leftover can be refrigerated for 2 to 3 days.</li>
<li>Serve chhena poda as dessert after meals or as a sweet snack.</li>

Helpful Tips & Notes

          <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">
              While everywhere else, dahi vada and aloo dum are considered to be two separate dishes, Odisha offers a distinctive blend of the both. The relishing taste of dahi vadas carefully neutralises the spiciness of aloo dum, giving the taste that every Odia craves for. Also famous as the 'Vada Pav' of Cuttack, this dish has surely paved its way into people's hearts and everyday lives.

           <div class="left"><p style="font-size: 30px; color: green; margin-left: 20px;">How to make Chungdi malai</p>
               <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
                   <li>For Making Dahi Vada : Make a thick paste by grinding soaked urad dal.(try not to add too much of water else it will be difficult to shape the vada later). Add salt and rava. Mix and keep aside</li>
                   <li>In a big wide container mix curd, water, grated ginger, grated mango ginger(if using).Keep aside.</li>
                   <li>In a pan heat 1 tbsp oil. Add mustard seeds, Cumin, Urad dal, Curry leaves, dry red chillies, split green chilli. When the mustard seeds starts to crackle and the tampering is aromatic switch off the gas. Let it cool down for 5 minutes and then add to curd mixture.</li>
                   <li>Next beat the urad dal paste vigorously using your hand. It's the difficult but most crucial step of the process. The more you beat, the more you will incorporate air into the batter. To know the batter is ready, drop a small piece of batter into the water. If it floats then consider it as ready, else some more muscle work.</li>
                   <li>Heat oil in a kadhai for deep frying the vada. When the oil is medium-high hot take small portions of batter and shape it. Slowly slide into the hot oil. The oil should not be too hot, else the vadas will remain undercooked.</li>
                   <li>You would see the vadas will start floating. Drop in some more shaped vadas into the oil. Don't overcrowd the pan. Fry till the they look light golden brown in colour on both the sides.</li>
                   <li>Once the vadas are done, remove them from oil using a slotted spoon and put immediately into the water. Let them sit in water for 5-8 minutes. Then remove from water and squeeze the vadas in between two palms to drain excess water. Add to curd mixture.</li>
                   <li>Repeat the above frying, soaking in water and finally putting into the curd mixture process for the remaining batter.</li>
                   <li>Carefully turn the vadas ones ,so that they are evenly soaked in curd.While the Vadas are soaking in curd mixture we will prepare Aloo Dum.</li>
                   <li>_For Aloo _Dum : In a pan heat 2 tbsp oil. Add dry red chilies, tej patta. Add asafoetida. Add chopped Onion and fry till brown in colour.</li>
                   <li>Add Ginger garlic paste.Fry till the raw smell is gone. Add Chopped tomatoes. Cook until the tomatoes are soft and mushy. Add turmeric powder, Cumin , coriander powder, red chilli powder. Fry/bhuno until the oil is separated.</li>
                   <li>Add cubed potatoes. Fry for 6-7 minutes, till the potatoes are nicely coated with the spices and browned. Add garam masala. Mix well. Add water. Bring the curry to a boil, roughly for 10 minutes.</li>
                   <li>Serve dahi bara, topped with warm Aloo dum and garnished with chopped onion, sev, coriander leaves. And off-course dusted with lots of roasted cumin,red chilli powder and chat masala.</li>
