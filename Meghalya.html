         <p style="font-size: 23px; margin-left: 20px;">Blessed with abundant greenery, wettest place on earth, crystal clear rivers, high hills, flat plains, countless waterfalls and amazing culture, Meghalaya is probably the most beautiful state in India. Not only would you find Meghalaya endowed with immense natural beauty, if you go about understanding the ways of this part of the world, you will without a doubt be left startled. Nicknamed as 'Scotland of the east' by British empire, Meghalaya also boasts of 'Asia's cleanest village' - Mawlynnong adjudged by Discover India magazine. Meghalaya has kind of remained cut-off from mainstream India just like other North Eastern states. This has allowed it to preserve its true spirit and prevent itself from the rapid commercialization seen in many other parts of India. Meghalaya has thus remained relatively pure both in terms of geographical landscapes and heart's of people and culture of the state; and this is what makes it a must visit place for travelers.</p>

              <ul style="font-size: 20px;"> <li> I used store-bough rice flour,so i dry roasted the flour for 2 minutes, until it was hot to touch. Let it cool and then proceed to make the putharo’s.</li>
                  <li>If using home-made rice flour, then skip the above step.</li>
<li>Take the rice flour in a flat plate, add salt and sprinkle warm water  2-3 times and start mixing the rice. you should be able to hold the flour in your fist and when pressed, it should hold shape and when crumbled it should crumble well. Add jaggery and fresh coconut, mix well.</li>
<li>Take two small bowls/silicon moulds or a flat earthen ware will also do good. I used two steel katori’s/bowl, grease the bowls, fill the bowls with the rice flour mixture. I filled till half their capacity.</li>

<li>Cover the bowls with a piece of parchment paper, to avoid water dripping into the bowl while steaming. Steam cook for 10-12 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove from the steamer, let it cool for 2 minutes, the carefully unmould it on to a serving plate. Serve Warm.</li>
