          <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">
              For a healthy breakfast/snack option, Sarva Pindi is an excellent choice as it is cooked with at least one component of each stage of the food pyramid. It is a savoury pancake made of rice flour, chana dal, peanuts and chilli. It is cooked in a deep, round shaped pan and to preserve the sanctity of the recipe, it is pertinent to make holes in the rolled out dough mixture before cooking it. It is also called Ginne Appa owing to its preparation.

                     <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
                         Basic Prep
                         <li>Soak the Chana Dal in ¼ cup for at least 1 hour. After 1 hour, drain all the water from the chana dal.</li>
                         <li>Crush the peanuts a bit to break them up into smaller pieces.</li>
Making the Dough
<li>To the rice flour, add the crushed peanuts, soaked and drained chana dal, sesame, green chillies, curry leaves, coriander, red chilli powder, turmeric, and salt.</li>
Mix well.
<li>Next add a little water at a time and knead into a firm dough.</li>
<li>Divide into 3 portions and roll each portion into a ball.</li>
Shaping the Sarva Pindi
<li>To a cold kadhai, add 1/4 tsp of oil and spread it. A well-greased, cold kadhai or tava is the important part here.</li>
<li>Place one portion of the dough in the centre of the kadhai, and gently press it to form a circle about 5” in diameter.</li>
<li>Using your index finger, make a few holes in the Sarva Pindi.</li>
<li>Add a few drops of oil into each of these holes.</li>
Cooking the Sarva Pindi
<li>Cover the kadhai, and place it on a stove on medium flame.</li>
<li>Remove the Sarva Pindi from the Kadhai or Tava, and transfer to a plate to cool. We do not have to cook the other side.</li>
<li>Wash the Kadhai or Tava to cool it completely, and then make the next Sarva Pindi. You can also use multiple tavas or kadhais to cook multiple Sarva Pindi’s simultaneously.</li>
<li>Store the Sarva Pindi in an air-tight container.</li>
